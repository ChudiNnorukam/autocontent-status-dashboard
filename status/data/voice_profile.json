    "I built the first version of Feature X blindfolded—no user feedback, no sketches. It shipped. It failed. Lesson: seeing pain before coding saves way more time than tweaking UI.",
    "I once delayed feature X because I thought I didn’t have capacity. Feedback: users commented “we need this.” Fix: simplified scope, shipped minimal version. Lesson: imperfect > invisible.",
    "Mistake: I built integrations (Slack, email) thinking they were demand. Feedback: “I don’t care.” Removed them. Lesson: enthusiasm ≠ necessity.",
    "I thought expanding platforms (mobile/web) is always a win. Feedback: web version usage dwarfed mobile. Fix: focused web first. Lesson: follow where people actually use, not where you want them to.",
    "Got negative feedback when I skipped onboarding UX. Users thought feature was broken. Fix: added simple guide. Lesson: sometimes “explain what this is” matters more than shiny visuals."
